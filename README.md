# 👋 Hi there, I’m Cu pid

## About Me  

I’m a backend-focused software engineer passionate about designing and building scalable ⚡ high-performance systems. My expertise spans distributed architectures, real-time messaging 💬, API optimization, and AI integrations 🤖. I work primarily with Go and Python 🐍, leveraging tools like gRPC, PostgreSQL 🐘, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ 🐇, Redis, Docker 🐳, and AWS ☁️ to deliver robust, reliable solutions.  

I thrive on solving complex technical challenges 🧠, from reducing latency in high-volume applications to architecting microservices that handle millions of requests seamlessly. Beyond code, I care deeply about maintainability, developer experience 💡, and shipping software that makes a measurable impact 🚀.
